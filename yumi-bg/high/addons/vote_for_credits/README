VOTE FOR CREDITS ADD-ON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for purchasing this add-on, if you have any questions regarding issues
related to support or setup, you may reach me (Byteflux) via shugotenshi@gmail.com
or IRC @ irc.deltanime.net (channel #flux).

You may install this add-on by placing it into your Flux's 'addons' folder, so
that it may look like this: FLUX_ROOT/addons/vote_for_credits

Once you have done so you may navigate your browser to your Flux address and you
will be prompted with the install & update screen, at which point you can
automatically install the database tables that are used by the add-on.


POST-INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After completing installation, you will see that you have a "Vote for Credits"
menu on the left navigation bar, and a "Voting Banners" link in the admin menu.

The voting banners admin areas are for managing your topsite banners that users
can click and earn credits from in the "Vote for Credits" page.

One thing to note is that this can be easily abused by people who create new
accounts and transfer credits using the "Transfer Credits" feature, you should
consider disabling the credit transfering feature to prevent this kind of abuse.
You can disable the feature by opening FLUX_ROOT/config/access.php and looking
for where it says "'transfer' => AccountLevel::NORMAL" and changing it to
something like AccountLevel::ADMIN so that normal users cannot transfer credits.

This add-on also supports cash points, which is probably more secure than
credits, but it means you won't be able to use the CP to purchase items with
cash points for voters.  However, you can always use the cashpoint shop in-game.

To use kafra points, make sure both ChangeToCashPoints and DepositKafraPoints
are set to true in the addon's config/addon.php config file.

If you would like to change the page title or heading, open the lang/en_us.php
file and change each value as you see fit. Most of the labels and text are
customizable, so modify as you want :)

If you have any further questions, please do not hestitate to contact me.
